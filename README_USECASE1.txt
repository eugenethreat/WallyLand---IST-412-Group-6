Use Case 1 - Viewing Ride Wait Times 

This use case involves users being able to view information about ride wait times at the park. After logging in (there are lists of credentials in the UserList.java) the user can select "view wait times" and view a map of the park and a list of rides along with their current estimated wait time. 

In the future, we hope to be able to have users switch between these two views (ie - be able to hover over the image and get the corresponding ride's wait time) or just be able to view the list. Sorting the list by a characteristic (name, wait time, capacity, or hours) could be useful for the user experience as well by allowing users to further narrow their search.
